                  <p>Clinical Research is a side-stream of healthcare sciences. Clinical Phases are the main part of
                    Clinical Research. It determines the safety and effectiveness of medicines, equipment, and
                    diagnostic products etc., prior to release in the market. Sometimes, people get confused between
                    Clinical Research and Clinical Practice. The difference is, one is to collect evidence to establish
                    a treatment, while lateral is used to establish treatments itself. Clinical Research is referred to
                    the complete bibliography of a drug, device or a biological test. No doubt that there is a huge
                    requirement in Clinical Research in India. <br>
                    Clinical Research is a current knowledge-intensive and booming industry. It is one of the industry
                    growing at an astonishing rate and opening up a wide scope of employment opportunities for trained
                    professionals. It provides scientific analysis of the impact, risks and benefits of medicines or a
                    medicinal product. The trials are done before initiating the products in the market. The tests are
                    performed at different stages and after-launch supervision is maintained to scrutinize the safety
                    and monitor the side effects if any. It is the best time to become part of this fast evolving
                    industry. And an educational qualification in clinical research will help you suffice. <br> 
                    India is evolving in many phases to run the race in the world and Clinical Research is one such
                    phase where India is making remarkable development and growth. India has been involved in Clinical
                    Research for the past many years and is now on its way to becoming a major focus for it. The billion
                    dollar industry is already witnessing high demand for qualified professionals. Indian pharmaceutical
                    industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of the Indian economy and has made rapid strides over
                    the years. There is a massive need for Clinical Research professionals in this fast-growing field.
                    Clinical Research makes an interesting career option with a great scope for professional growth. To
                    build a career in Clinical Research, basic education in this field is necessary and a good hands on
                    is the need. <br>
                    Testing new drugs is a slow, expensive, and manual process. Artificial intelligence has the
                    potential to disrupt every stage of the Clinical Trials process from matching eligible patients to
                    studies to monitoring adherence and data collection. Artificial intelligence is touted as the magic
                    bullet for everything, and the technology could have huge potential for streamlining the clinical
                    trial process, for remote monitoring, to Machine learning to AI-based cyber security for data
                    protection. <br>
                    Clinical Research is a booming industry which offers rewarding career options to the aspirants. It
                    plays a vital role in introducing new drugs and improving health statistics. In India, the scope of
                    Clinical Research is raising its global standards to introduce new medicines to cure various
                    illnesses. In the upcoming years, India is going to become a global hub for Clinical Research. Hence
                    grocareer is taking initiatives to place students professionally in this field. Clinical Research is
                    conducted at various affiliated academic medical centers and research centers. We provide quality
                    learning ecosystem which involves networking sites, pharmaceutical companies, emerging technologies,
                    managing data and various operational factors related to this field. One can also find various job

                ‘Blockchain’ no longer
                sounds alien, but at the same time, possibly triggers more questions than answers. The survey,
                respondents were asked their views on the impact that Blockchain technology is likely to have on the
                Financial Services industry. An overwhelming 92%13 of respondents believed that Blockchain is going to
                disrupt their industry over the next five years. The World Economic Forum estimates that, by next coming
                years, 80% of all Banks are going to initiate projects concerning Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
                the underlying technology supporting a Blockchain. In the past 3 years, start-ups working on Blockchain
                have attracted venture capital funding of over $1.4 Billion. During the same period, over 2500 patents
                have been filed and over 90 Central Banks are presently engaged in DLT related discussions worldwide.
                All these statistics point to the unparalleled excitement triggered by a technology whose first contours
                were defined less than a decade back, just when the global financial services industry faced one of its
                toughest challenges in recent memory!
