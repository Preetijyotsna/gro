                  <p>As India moves ahead with its vision to become an economic behemoth in the next few years, the
                    average level of prosperity among its populace and the degree of equitable distribution of wealth
                    will, to a large extent, be determined by the scale of inclusive growth achieved. In response to the
                    evolving forces of customer expectations, regulatory requirements, technology, demographics, new
                    competitors and shifting economics, much of the landscape will change significantly. Banks need to
                    choose what posture to adopt against this change, whether to be a shaper of the future, a fast
                    follower, or to manage defensively, putting off change. Staying the same is not an option. In the
                    field of technology based banking, information technology and electronic funds transfer system have
                    emerged as the twin pillars of modern banking development. Products offered by banks have moved way
                    beyond conventional banking and access to these services have become round the clock. This, indeed,
                    is a revolution in Indian banking industry. </p>

                  <p>Payments banks will open another alternative channel after internet and mobile banking, and help
                    improve efficiencies and reduce costs involved in catering to customers in the rural and semi-urban
                    areas. The ‘Digital India Campaign’ launched in July 2015 by the Government of India, with an aim to
                    ensure that the Government services and subsidy benefits are made available to citizens
                    electronically by improving online infrastructure and by increasing Internet connectivity will pave
                    way for technological reforms in India and make the country digitally empowered. Another extremely
                    important issue is the infrastructure financing. Banks have been the primary source of funding for
                    the infrastructure sector. As a result, banking sector credit to the infrastructure sector has also
                    increased to around Rs 10 trillion and accounted for around 15% of the overall banking sector
                    advances.</p>
                  <br><br>
                  <p> Infrastructure advances have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 25% in the
                    last 10 years, which is higher than the banking sector advances growth. India’s financial regulators
                    have helped build one of the world’s strongest banking and financial systems that has sailed past
                    international crises. They are now injecting more competition by allowing different classes of banks
                    and financial service providers. The Government is also stepping in with the bankruptcy law and the
                    Bank Boards bureau, which will make it easier to do business. It is in this context, we hope that
                    this report on Banking on the Future vision 2020 would help the industry to understand the future
                    evolution of banking and the evolving strategies for reaping maximum benefits from the changing
                    scenario in banking and financial landscape.
                    <br><br>
                    “Banking on the future : Vision 2020” select key changes that banks need to make in their go-to
                    market approach, starting with shortening their strategy cycles to months instead of years, getting
                    better at reading signals of change in this disruptive environment, and becoming tactically focused
                    on being operationally lean and agile in response to market conditions. This will result in choices
                    being made to adopt or partner businesses offering digital interactions and to accept that there are
                    alternatives to core legacy IT systems offering greater speed to revenue generation, effective
                    operations and better customer experience. Technology has democratized businesses by creating access
                    across all levels and by creating a level playing field.
                    With several new players entering the banking scene, the sector is set to witness unprecedented
                    changes in the times to come. The Financial Inclusion agenda has led to several types of banking
                    models like small banks, payment banks, and on tap license for new banks. The agenda has also taken
                    a step forward to include new non-bank players in the space who are vying to grab a larger share of
                    the Banking value chain. While, on the one hand, this allows last mile connectivity and lowering of
                    cost to the end customer, it causes huge disruption in the banking environment, possibly leading to
                    a realignment of players in the market as we look ahead to the year 2020.

              <p style="color: azure;"> If one is involved in the area of Banking Technology, chances are that the word
                ‘Blockchain’ no longer
                sounds alien, but at the same time, possibly triggers more questions than answers. The survey,
                respondents were asked their views on the impact that Blockchain technology is likely to have on the
                Financial Services industry. An overwhelming 92%13 of respondents believed that Blockchain is going to
                disrupt their industry over the next five years. The World Economic Forum estimates that, by next coming
                years, 80% of all Banks are going to initiate projects concerning Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
                the underlying technology supporting a Blockchain. In the past 3 years, start-ups working on Blockchain
                have attracted venture capital funding of over $1.4 Billion. During the same period, over 2500 patents
                have been filed and over 90 Central Banks are presently engaged in DLT related discussions worldwide.
                All these statistics point to the unparalleled excitement triggered by a technology whose first contours
                were defined less than a decade back, just when the global financial services industry faced one of its
                toughest challenges in recent memory!

            <b>
              <p style="color: azure;">The spectrum of automation expands from simple rule based automation to advanced
                cognitive and artificial intelligence automation. Hence, the task of exploring and understanding
                automation can often appear more daunting than it is. Let’s take a step back and deconstruct this
                spectrum of automation in detail. The ability of the tool and solution to automate depends on three
                factors that is the type of input it can read, the amount data it can process, and the nature of output
                it can generate. Typically, as the variability of the input increases, the amount of data to be
                processed multiplies and the output moves from being deterministic to predictive, i.e., the solution
                moves from left to right on the spectrum. Robotics Process Automation (often referred to as ‘RPA’) sits
                at one end of this spectrum.</p> <br>

                banks for the regulators, nobody wants to be on the wrong side of the headline. One reason this
                continues to loom large is that the nature of the threat is constantly evolving, and not just from a
                technology perspective. For example, today a bank may be threatened not just by groups that are looking
                to steal money, but by actors that may simply want to be disruptive. Banking industry in India is
                rapidly evolving facilitated by mobile and internet penetration in the country and technological
                innovations disrupting the established processes. In the last couple of years, technologies such as

                (OTP) have become main stream in India. These innovations were designed to make payment transactions
                convenient and more secure.
