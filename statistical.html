                                        to SAS proprietary architecture, building on the SAS platform necessarily means
                                        a long-term bet on the future of the company.
                                        A recent report noted that SAS posted revenue of US $3.24 billion, which was up
                                        1.25% from 2016. When compared with other profit companies in the predictive and
                                        advanced analytics space, SAS was reported to have the largest market share
                                        amongst its competitors at 30.5%. SAS continues to expand its solutions into new

                                        areas. The ‘Digital India Campaign’ launched in July 2015 by the Government of
                                        India, with an aim to
                                        ensure that the Government services and subsidy benefits are made available to

                                        the infrastructure sector. As a result, banking sector credit to the
                                        infrastructure sector has also
                                        increased to around Rs 10 trillion and accounted for around 15% of the overall

                                    <p> SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is the world's fastest and powerful software
                                        for data management, data mining, report writing, statistical analysis, business
                                        modelling, applications development and data warehousing. Knowing SAS is an
                                        asset in many job markets. Beside this there are many analytics companies using
                                        SAS and as there are many companies in this sector, there is always a
                                        requirement for skilled employee.
                                        There is a rising demand for inference from data coupled with the arrival of new
                                        software and hardware technologies which evaluates the current availability of
                                        tools across different statistical languages, both domain-specific varieties
                                        such as R and Statistics, and general purpose computing languages like Python
                                        that are on the cusp of great innovation and the development of better tools
                                        will only hasten this progress, but there must be careful consideration over the

                                        Every action you take on Amazon, Netflix, Google, Facebook, YouTube etc., is fed
                                        into their artificial intelligence algorithms to learn more about you and offer
                                        more of what (they think) you want. AI isn't only the basis of recommender
                                        systems. The natural language processing of the self-driving cars of Google or
                                        Tesla, even game-winning abilities of IBM's Deep Blue. AI is now embedded in a
                                        massive range of technologies we already take for granted. <br>

                                        At the heart of this artificial intelligence is machine learning the ability of
                                        programs to learn from previous data to predict future events. And machine
                                        learning, when you break it down, is just very fast, very advanced statistical
                                        modelling. In statistics, regression analysis determines the relationships
                                        between points in a data set. The relationship is described by an equation which
                                        can be used to predict future outcomes. The equation is graphed to display a
                                        curve emerging from a smattering of data.<br>
                                        In drug effect evaluation, it is most important to make efforts to eliminate
                                        various biases at the stage of clinical practice, where necessary observation is
                                        made, and of data collection and analysis. It is therefore utmost essential to
                                        adopt a double-blind test with random allocation and appropriate statistical
                                        techniques for data analysis. Although this procedure is currently followed in
                                        drug effect evaluation, there still remain further improvements.<br>
                                        One of them is connected to a false judgment (evaluation) due to the improper
                                        use of statistical techniques. The present guidelines aim to provide the most
                                        suitable principles at this point of time by pointing out the misapplication of
                                        statistical technique, preventing it and thus assuring scientifically sound drug
                                        evaluation. Even though proper statistical techniques are used, valid drug
                                        effect evaluation cannot be achieved from data with poor quality and
                                        reliability. Some principles to be followed to improve the quality and
                                        reliability of data are already set forth in other guidelines of GCP.<br>
                                        Furthermore, it is a principle to conduct comparative clinical studies at more
                                        than one institution (group), which secure the data applicability beyond the
                                        possible regional and inter-institutional variations. The present guidelines
                                        deal mainly with parallel intergroup comparison in clinical studies designed for
                                        verification. For example, the crossover method indeed has theoretical values
                                        and, as a matter of fact, is considered the best way in clinical studies in
                                        patients with rare disease. In study conduct and evaluation, however, this
                                        method involves such difficult problems as the influence of a carry-over effect
                                        and changes in the baseline value in most clinical trials intended for drug
                                        effect evaluation. Statistical inference can be roughly divided into two main
                                        categories: "test" and "estimation."<br>
                                        Since statistical tests have been widely used, most explanation is given in this
                                        document by
                                        using them as examples. In general, however, usefulness estimation provides much
                                        information
                                        useful in clinical practice as to the degree of usefulness of the
                                        investigational drug rather
                                        than as to simply whether or not the investigational drug is more useful than
                                        the control drug.
                                        Therefore, it is desirable that point and interval estimation data be furnished
                                        where possible
                                        along with test data. A new investigational drug should, in principle, be
                                        approved only when it
                                        is evaluated as being superior or equal to an already approved drug of the same
                                        kind and
                                        efficacy. It is statistically questionable to consider the investigational drug
                                        equal to the
                                        control drug on the ground that no significant difference is found between them
                                        at a comparative
                                        study. With consideration for clinical practicality, the use of the method for
                                        providing
                                        significant evidence to indicate that the investigational drug is not inferior
                                        to the control
                                        drug outside the allowable range is proposed in the present guidelines.
                                        Applicants are requested
                                        to utilize this method and further develop better way. It is recommended that
                                        reliable drug
                                        effect evaluation documents of high quality be prepared in accordance with these
                                        guidelines
                                        SAS still have a great future and I don't see it fading away in near future. The
                                        reason for
                                        being so optimistic about SAS as the Pharma Industry & Drug regulators like Data
                                        analysis of
                                        Clinical trial is completely depending on SAS, the preferred tool for all the
                                        drug regulators
                                        all over the world. Pharma companies have invested millions of dollars to build
                                        tools (SAS
                                        macros) for reporting and analysis purpose and it won't just go away easily.
                                        Moreover FDA and
                                        other regulators too have to validate these clinical trial outputs and hence
                                        they would be even
                                        more reluctant to replace SAS with any other tool as there is a huge cost and
                                        time associated to
                                        it. <br>

                        Statistics edge being born in North Carolina university, SAS is one of the trusted software for
                        Statistical analysis and this is one of the reason why Pharma industry and Banks where a wrong
                        analysis can cost a billion dollars to company, rely on it so much. However, R is also gaining
                        popularity within Statistics community gradually because of its free availability, good graphics
                        and growing online support. <br>
                        SAS research & development as SAS has been providing analytics solutions to many industries over
                        a very long period of time and hence they understand industry & their customers better than any
                        other software company. To survive in the market one must need to adapt itself with changing
                        technology and SAS is quite proactive in its approach, for example, Hadoop is not very old in
                        the big data industry but SAS has a well-established product supporting Hadoop and other
                        components of Big data. <br>
                        Switch to the highest earning career of 21st Century with SAS Artificial Intelligence, machine
                        learning, deep learning and Analytics.
                        While there were a number of professionals working inside of the SAS programming environment,
                        they did everything but code. Another interesting fact about this data analytical tool is that
                        most of the professionals who actually worked with it, were not Data Scientists, they actually
                        weren’t even Data Analysts. These were just the decision makers, the top tier of the firms which
                        were responsible for taking decisions and would rather need a proper professional to code for
                        them, in order to help them achieve their goals. <br>
                        Fast forward to today, when the SAS programmers in the Data Science industry are getting paid as
                        handsomely as ever. The average annual salary of a Data Analyst has increased two fold to almost
                        three fold in the past two, three decades. While the salary has multiplied, so have the
                        responsibilities that a professional has to take care of. In comparison to those who worked
                        around SAS codes in the past, today there is a significant increase in both the pressures and
                        roles of the professionals of today. SAS programmers today do way more than just coding today,
                        with the emergence of the concepts of Big Data, Data Science and Big Data Analytics.
